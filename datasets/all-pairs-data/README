Overview
========

This dataset was used in the application section of our IMC 2015 paper (1) to
demonstrate the ability to speed up a classic deanonymization attack on Tor,
and (2) to show the existence of TIVs and how they can be exploited to construct
lower latency Tor circuits. Please see the paper for more details.

We chose 50 relays from the live Tor network (that we do not control) and used
Ting to measure the latency between all pairs of them.



Data Files
==========

This section describes the format of each data file in this directory.

[relays-details.json]: Details document from Onionoo listing all the available
information for the 50 relays. The format of this document is described at 
https://onionoo.torproject.org/protocol.html


[relays-bandwidth.txt]: Bandwidth information parsed from relays-details.json
that was used in the realistic weighted-node selection version of the
deanonymization application in section 5.1.1 of the paper.

  ip consensus_weight consensus_weight_fraction guard_probability middle_probability exit_probability


[all-pairs-tings.json]: Raw json output directly from running ting on all pairs
of the 50 relays. 

  {
    "measurements": { 
      "x" : [...], // samples from circuit wxz
      "y" : [...], // samples from circuit wyz
      "xy" : [...] // samples from circuit wxyz
    },
    "ips" : [ip_x, ip_y],
    "fps" : [fp_x, fp_y], // fp = unique tor fingerprint id
    "time" : {
      "build_x" : ..., // time to build circuit wxz

      "build_y" : ...,

      "build_xy" : ...,

      "total" : ...
    },
    "estimate" : ... // min(xy) - .5min(x) - .5min(y), used in planetlab-summary.txt
  }


[all-pairs-rtt.csv]: Just the ting-measured RTT ("estimate" field from json 
output above) between all pairs.

  (format described in column and row headers of CSV) 




Measurement Details
===================

All measurements were taken on November 8 and 9, 2014.
