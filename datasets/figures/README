Overview
========

This directory contains all of the data files used to create the figures in our IMC
2015 paper. 



List of Figures
===============

Figure 3: CDF of Ting latencies compared to Ping latencies
  > est-real-all.out 

  ip1 ip2 ting ping relative-error additive-error additive-error-normalized


Figure 4: Figure 3 broken into 4 CDFs binned by ping-measured latency
  > est-real-all.out


Figure 5: Forwarding delays measured on the PlanetLab relays using TCP and ICMP
  > forwarding-boxplot.out

  pair# min_icmp 1q_icmp median_icmp 3q_icmp max_icmp min_tcp 1q_tcp median_tcp 3q_tcp max_tcp


Figure 6: Cumulative number of tings necessary to reach given thresholds of min
  > cumulative-tings.out
  (each column represents # number of samples required to get within X of min)

  10% 5% 1% 1ms exact


Figure 7: Comparison of 200 vs. 1000 Ting samples
  > 1.out (200 samples) compared to 2.out (1000 samples)

  (same format as est-real-all.out)


Figure 8: Relationship between geographic distance and ting-measured RTTs
  > gcd-vs-rtt.out

  distance rtt ip1 ip2 
  
  (where distance is great circle distance measured in kilometers)


Figure 9: Coefficient of variation of latencies measured by Ting
  > cv.out

  ip1 ip2 coefficient_of_variation


Figure 10: Boxplot of variation of latencies measured by Ting
  > boxplot_var.out

  pair# min 1q median 3q max ip1 ip2 


Figures 11-17: coming soon


Figure 18: Number of total relays and unique /24s in the Tor network over time
  > 24-over-time.out

  year-month-day-hour #slash_24s #total
