Overview
========

This dataset was used to evaluate Ting's accuracy in our IMC 2015 paper.

We ran Tor relays on 31 PlanetLab nodes (whose locations and ips can be found in
planetlab-nodes.txt), measured the latency between all 930 pairs of nodes using
ting, and then compared this to the latency measured using ping. 




Data Files
==========

This section describes the format of each data file in this directory.


[planetlab-nodes.txt]: A list of the 31 PlanetLab nodes used to run the Tor
relays for this experiment. 

  ip hostname

j
[planetlab-pings.txt]: Standard statistics reported by the ping tool for 50
pings between each pair of nodes.

  ip1 ip2 min/mean/max/std_dev


[planetlab-tings.json]: Full json output of ting tool for 50 samples of each
circuit between each pair of nodes. 

  {
    "measurements": { 
      "x" : [...], // samples from circuit wxz
      "y" : [...], // samples from circuit wyz
      "xy" : [...] // samples from circuit wxyz
    },
    "ips" : [ip_w, ip_x, ip_y, ip_z],
    "fps" : [fp_w, fp_x, fp_y, fp_z], // fp = unique tor fingerprint id
    "time" : {
      "build_x" : ..., // time to build circuit wxz
      "ting_x" : ..., // time to measure circuit wxz
      "build_y" : ...,
      "ting_y" : ...,
      "build_xy" : ...,
      "ting_xy" : ...,
      "total" : ...
    },
    "estimate" : ... // min(xy) - .5min(x) - .5min(y), used in planetlab-summary.txt
  }

        
[planetlab-summary.txt]: A summary of the minimum ping and ting measurements for
each pair (ip1,ip2). 

  ip1 ip2 ting ping relative-error additive-error additive-error-normalized

    relative-error = ting / ping
    additive-error = ting - ping
    additive-error-normalized = (ting-ping)/ping
